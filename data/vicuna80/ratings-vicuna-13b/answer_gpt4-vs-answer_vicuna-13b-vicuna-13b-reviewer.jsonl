The AI assistant followed the correct steps to solve the equation.\n\nAssistant 2's answer:\n\n[The Start of Assistant 2's Answer]\nWe can solve this equation using the following steps:\n\n1. Simplify the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation by moving all the terms to one side and the numbers to the other: 3x + 10 = 5x - 10\n2. Combine the terms on the left-hand side by subtracting 5x from both sides: 3x = -5x\n3. Simplify the left-hand side by dividing both sides by 3: x = -5/3\n4. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to get the solution in terms of the natural logarithm base e: ln|x| = ln|-5/3| = -5/3 ln|e| = -5/3 ln(1.414) = -5/3 ln(1 + 1/1.414) = -5/3 ln(1.414) = -5/3 ln(1.414)\n5. Exponentiate both sides to get the solution in terms of e: x = e^(-5/3)\n6. Rearrange the solution to get x in terms of Euler's number: x = e^(-5/3) = 1/1.414^(-5/3) = 0.5877\n7. Round the solution to the desired number of decimal places: x = 0.5877\n\nTherefore, x = 0.5877 is the solution to the equation 3x + 10 = 5(x - 2).\n\n[The End of Assistant 2's Answer]\n\nAssistant 2's answer is also correct.
